# Social Voting and Graph Algorithms

### Introduction

My first three years of College and majoring in Computer Science I had one goal of expanding my breadth of knowledge in the Computer Science realm.  
I have explored the fields of Scientific Computing, Android Application Development, Assembly and Computer System principles, Game Design and Visual Programming, web design, Encryption, etc.
I have gained an (at least basic) intuitive understanding of each of these fields to develop myself as a well rounded Computer Scientist. For my senior year, I am focusing on further exploring depths of certain fields and make myself ready as a competent competitor for namely two categories : IOS/Android Application development and Artifical Intelligence. 

For the Summer of 2020 I decided to keep myself very busy with my fields of interests. In the prior 2/3rds of the Summer, I explored fields such as Graph Theory and Finite Calculus, built my own [website](http://www.eneadodi.com), and completed a multidude (30+) of Computer Science Interview Preperation Questions.

**During the first 2/3rds of Summer 2020 I also:**

* Impletemented various algorithms from scratch (in C++ or Java) such as:
    * Djikstra's algorithm 
    * Kruskal's algorithm
    * BFS & DFS
    * Quicksort and Mergesort
 
* Read the works of Great Philosophers such as:
    * Immanuel Kant
    * Ren√© Descartes
    * Aristotle
    * Confucius
 
* Changed my morning routine to include Meditation and Cold Showers

* Stayed Physically active and exercised most days of the week

* Learned [Usher's Waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ulenPf_II) in it's entireity on Classical Guitar

* Made time to have fun too!

**The Final Third of Summer 2020 I plan to implement my knowledge and buld projects to feature on my resume.**

1) Machine Learning Stock Predictor
2) Social Voting Theory Android Application 
3) Philosophical Essay

### Summer 2020 Project 2 : Social Voting Theory Android Application

While the Android Application itself will have its own dedicated Repository, The algorithms uesd in the Applicaiton will be developed/pushed here.
Be it for a head start, rememberance, and/or simply necessity to create certain Condorcet algorithms, I built/will built from scratch:
 * Generic Vertex Class
 * Generic Weighted & Unweighted Edge Class
 * Generic Weighted & Unweighted Graph Class
 * BFS
 * DFS 
 * Djikstra
 * Tideman Method
 * Kemeny-Young Method
